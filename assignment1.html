    <h3>My Trip To California</h3>
    <p>It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our 
        vehicle and headed to Nourthern California
         for the 4th of July weekened for a family 
         reunion. We then made haste to Magic
          Mountain. By the time we returned home,
           we had traveled some 1,300 miles in 
           three and one half days.</p>
           <br>
    <h3>My Trip To the Rockies</h3>
    <p>After a year's preparation, it was time to
        go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We 
        flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air 
        Force Academy, Pike's Peak, Garden of the
         Gods, and the Olympic traaining center. 
         WE chartered a bus to the Philmont Scour 
         Ranch in Northern New Mexico and began our
          60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we 
          boarded Arntrack's and rode to the rails 
          to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.</p>
          <br>
    <h3>My Trip to the Mid West</h3>
    <p>My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illnois, and Detroit, Michigan. We then boarded Amtrak in Chicago, and rode it to SAlt Lake City, where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.</p><br>
